				<h2>Summary</h2>
				

		          <p>For many years I have been working as a photographer and graphic designer, both self-employed and for employer. 
		             I have achieved some success in this area, but the desire to develop further led me to the decision to change 
			     my current occupation and get a qualification in software development or web design. I like to conquer new heights 
			     (literally and figuratively) and feel constant personal progress. Excellent organisational and time management 
			     skills with a highly developed attention to detail and accuracy. An interest in visual culture, design history 
			     and its contemporary practitioners. An interest in independent learning and ambition to progress as a web designer 
			     or software developer. Other interests: trekking and Munro bagging, history and nature exploring, travels, 
			     reading books, art and photography.</p>
